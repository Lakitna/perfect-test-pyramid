      relationship during testing.

    observations: Somehow this one has 2 layers labeled "integration". One says "System Integration
      Tests", the other "Integration Tests". The difference is unclear.

      The bottom layer is green, the rest blue

      The bottom 2 layers are labeled "Whitebox tests". The ones above are labeled "Blackbox tests".
